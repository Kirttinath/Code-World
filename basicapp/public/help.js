/*Next.js is a full-stack React framework. It’s versatile and lets you create React apps of any size—from a mostly static blog to a complex dynamic application. To create a new Next.js project, run in your terminal:

Create a new Project npx :  create-next-app@latest

                         :  npx create-react-app projectname
then go to the file location means project nname folder i.e : cd projectname
the start the app by command : npm start


 ** Grab react and react-dom from npm, set up your custom build process with a bundler like Vite or Parcel, and add other tools as you need them for routing, static generation or server-side rendering, and more.

 For Vite :
       Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

command : npm create vite@latest

In vite we have install npm for run the app
So we go to that folder i.e cd projectname
command : npm install
then we can run the app by command : npm run dev
