useState and useEffect

What is useState :
___________________

- It's a hook that allows you to add state variables in functional components.
 The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.

What is useEffect :
__________________

 `useEffect` is a React Hook that allows you to perform side effects in your components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers. 

The `useEffect` hook accepts two arguments: a **function** and an **optional dependency array** ¹². The function is executed after every render of the component. 
The dependency array is used to specify the variables that the function depends on. If any of the variables in the dependency array change, the function is re-executed ¹².
